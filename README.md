SLAM & Navigation2-Based Serving Robot

LiDAR-Based SLAM Mapping
Builds a 2D indoor map using LiDAR and performs real-time robot localization.

Navigation2 Autonomous Navigation
Executes global path planning and local obstacle avoidance
to navigate autonomously to designated target positions.

Button-Based Call and Return Operation
Receives external button inputs as target IDs,
allowing the robot to move to predefined locations or return to a home position.

Target ID to Pose Mapping
Maps button-based table IDs to predefined map coordinates,
enabling a simple and UI-independent call system.

State-Based Behavior Control
Manages robot behavior using a simple state machine
(idle → navigate → arrived → return).

Real-World Hardware Validation
Verified SLAM, localization, and navigation behavior
on a physical robot platform, not simulation only.
